          <p>
            I am a passionate Software Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My expertise lies in creating dynamic, responsive, and scalable web applications using a variety of technologies <br>
On the front-end, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js to build interactive and user-friendly interfaces. On the back-end, I have experience with Java, JDBC, and MySQL, allowing me to develop robust and efficient server-side solutions. <br>
My journey as a developer has been driven by a passion for problem-solving, continuous learning, and innovation. I have worked on projects like a Netflix Clone (React.js, Firebase), a JDBC-based ATM system, and a Global Hospital & Blood Bank Management System (PHP, MySQL). These experiences have helped me gain expertise in RESTful APIs, authentication, and secure database management. <br>
I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy turning ideas into fully functional applications. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and constantly improving user experience and application performance. As an aspiring Full Stack Developer, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects.

          <p>The JDBC ATM Machine Project is a console-based application that simulates real-world ATM functionalities by integrating a relational database (e.g., MySQL) using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). It allows users to perform essential banking operations such as user authentication, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, and viewing transaction history. User data, including account details and transaction logs, are dynamically managed in the database, ensuring real-time updates and secure data handling. This project demonstrates core Java concepts, SQL integration, and database management, making it an excellent addition to a portfolio showcasing practical programming skills.</p>

          <p>The Global Hospital and Blood Bank project is a web-based application designed to streamline hospital management and facilitate seamless access to blood donation and transfusion services. The system provides a user-friendly interface for patients, donors, and administrators, ensuring efficient healthcare delivery and fostering a robust connection between hospitals and blood donors.

The project leverages technologies such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and DBMS to create a responsive and dynamic platform. Patients can easily register, book appointments, and access their medical records, while hospitals can manage staff schedules, patient details, and available medical facilities. A dedicated blood bank module allows users to search for blood donors or blood availability in real time, significantly reducing the time required for urgent transfusions.</p>
